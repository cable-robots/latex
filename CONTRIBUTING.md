## Reporting a bug with ```Cable Robots -- LaTeX Packages```


We work hard to process bugs that are reported, to assist with this please ensure the following details are always included:

- **Bug summary**: Make sure your summary reflects what the problem is and where it is.

- **Reproduce steps**: Clearly mention the steps to reproduce the bug.

- **Expected behavior**: How the document should be rendered on above mentioned steps.

- **Actual behavior**: What is the actual result on running above steps i.e. the bug behavior - **include any error messages**.

#### Here's how to report a bug on GitHub

1. **Register for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com),** if you don't already have one.

2. **Search for similar bugs.** Perhaps someone has already reported your issue! If so, please add clarification and/or more information to the **existing** bug.

3. **Create a new bug.** If you don't find any similar issues, you can report your bug via the "new issue" tab once you've logged in.

4. **Monitor your issue and respond to questions.** It may be necessary to provide additional information upon request or you might be asked if the bug still occurs after an update.

5. **Close your bug.** In case you notice that the bug doesn't occur anymore, you can close the issue yourself (don't forget to add a note saying the issue is resolved).

If you find out your bug is actually a duplicate of another bug and only notice that after you created it, please also close your bug with a short reference to the other issue that was there before.

## Feature requests

Only use GitHub if you are planning on contributing a new feature and developing it. If you want to discuss your idea first, before "officially" posting it anywhere, you can always contact the core team directly.

#### GitHub feature requests

Feature Requests submitted as GitHub Issues specifically mean *"I'd like to see this feature, I'm going to be working on some code to implement it."* It is more like a Pre-Pull Request, in which a developer signifies that he or she wants to see a feature implemented that they think would be really great, and they're committed to coding it.

It's a great way to launch discussions on the developer side of things because both the core team and the community developer get a chance to talk about the technical side of the feature implementation. It's a great way to exchange ideas about how the logic could work in code.

Please also review our [Developer's Guide](DEVELOPER.md)
