# Developer's Guide

How to contribute your own code to ```Cable Robots -- LaTeX Packages```

## Development Environment

To develop templates, you need the following minimum setup on your local system

* TeXLive >= 2019
  * LuaLaTeX
  * latexmk
  * biber
  * makeglossaries
* GNU make >= 3.50
* Python >= 3.7
  * bump2version
  * Pygments
* rsync > 3.1.*
* Any IDE or LaTeX editor

## Building

Currently, the compiled files are not tracked by git but are being built with every push to `master` using our GitLab server's CI. The build's artifacts i.e., all `.cls`, `.tex`, `.latexmkrc`, and other files, are then published for artifact download using GitLab CI.

For building the files locally, you can make use of our awesome `Makefile` with the build target `$ make all`. This will build all needed `.cls`, `.sty`, and other files, and will build all demo `pdf`

### Build Targets

| Target | Description | Depends |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `all` | Build all source files and all source documentations | `ins`, `demos` |
| `ins` | Run `pdflatex` on the installer `ins` file | |
| `demos` | Build demo `tex` files as `pdf` | |
| `clean` | Remove all created `.cls`, `.sty`, `.dict`, ... files | |
| `distclean` | Clean and also remove `dist/` directory | `clean` |
| `dist` | Copy all files into directory `dist/` | `ins` |
| `install` | Install all created files to global TeX directory `kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/cablerobot/` so that they are available system wide | `ins` |
| `uninstall` | Remove directory `kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/cablerobot/` | |

## Testing

The easiest way of testing your code for errors and avoiding to have to `make all` everytime, is by working inside the `src/` directory. In these folders you'll find sample `.tex` files for each class. These can be used to test your changes for errors or the desired output (luckily, LaTeX doesn't complain about any `\input` or `\include` inside a `.cls` file).

Additionally, you may be a dedicated shell user and run `latexmk` from within the `src/` directory. This will compile all available tex files from said directory.

There are no other or automated ways of testing your edits than above ways.

## Versioning

Automated versioning is configured via [`bumpversion`](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/). You have to install it e.g. via `pip` or with your package-manager. The versioning format is

```
{major}.{minor}.{patch}
```

To release a new patch, run in your local environment
```sh
bumpversion patch
```
and follow possible instructions on screen.
Automated Git operations are turned off by default for new versions.
You can automatically commit and tag your new version with

```sh
bumpversion --commit --tag {major|minor|patch}
```

The tags and commit messages are already preconfigured.

**Note:** The version number is raised according to the [Git flow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) i.e., `feature/*` branches should lead to new minor versions, `fix/*` branches to patch versions. Bumping the version should always occur in the `master` branch.
